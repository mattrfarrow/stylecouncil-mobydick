Solutions in Scala and Kotlin to a programming style exercise we did at Unruly:

Given a text file, output a word frequency count, in descending order of frequency. Normalise for case (so 'the' and 'The' are the same words). The input will already be stripped of punctuation: effectively, it's just a space-separated list of words.
